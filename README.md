## Recruitment Sankey Diagram

This is a quick and dirty project to visualize how my internship hunt went. The diagram splits off into different "flows" depending on which steps of the recruitment process I completed for each company. The results are aggregated in this flow diagram, and the flow width is proportional to how frequently I reached a step.

This repo is purely for my own entertainment, so you won't see anything groundbreaking or interesting here. The code's pretty sloppy right now, but I'm thinking of cleaning it up soon so fingers crossed.

## What I did

I keep track of my applications and how I do in a google sheet. I parse the .csv file and format the aggregate information so that I can feed it into [Google's visualization tool](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/sankey)

## Sample Outputs

I'm honestly super confused why more repositories don't show sample outputs of what their repo can do. It's super helpful and I would love to see more. But anyways, here's what my 2020 recruitment sankey diagram looks like.

## One Last Note

I have way more rejections than I show in my diagrams, so don't be discouraged even if you see a lot more! Good luck with your internship search :)

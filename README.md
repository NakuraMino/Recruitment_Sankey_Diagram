## Overview

This repository contains an overview of how my internship search for Summer 2020 went. I made the Sankey Diagram using [Google's visualization tool](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/sankey)

## What I did 
Since the start of the recruitment season, I've been keeping track of  all the companies I applied to, along with some key facts (applied date, interview dates, coding challenge, etc). I saw a few people making Sankey Diagrams of their results, so I thought I would do the same. 

I downloaded the Google Sheet I was using as a .csv file and wrote a Python script to reformat my information to work with Google's Sankey Diagram visualization tools. 

## By the Numbers

1. applied_total: 116
2. coding challenges: 9
3. Talks with Recruiter2
4. Phone Interviews: 4
5. On-Campus Interviews: 1
6. Onsite Interviews: 2
7. Offer: 1
8. Ghosted: 96

## One Last Note

I definitely got more than 18 rejection letters, but I got tired of updating my Google Sheets every time I saw a new one in my inbox. For those of you out there still recruiting, don't give up hope!

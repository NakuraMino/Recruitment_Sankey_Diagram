# Overview

This repository contains an overview of how my internship search for Summer 2020 went. I made the Sankey Diagram using [Google's visualization tool](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/sankey)

## What I did 
Ever since the start of the recruitment season, I kept track of a Google Sheet with all the companies I applied to, along with some key facts (applied date, interview dates, coding challenge, etc). I saw a few people making Sankey Diagrams of their results, so I thought I would do the same. 

I downloaded the Google Sheet as a .csv file and used a python script to reformat my information to work with Google's Sankey Diagram visualization tools. 

## Results 

I currently have an offer on the table, but I'm still actively exploring my options! As you can see, I'm still in an interview process with another company (a really cool one!!) right now, and I'm looking for an offseason (non-summer) internship to gain more experience and explore other companies!

# Overview

This repository contains an overview of how my internship search for Summer 2020 went. I made the Sankey Diagram using [Google's visualization tool](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/sankey)

## What I did 
Since the start of the recruitment season, I've been keeping track of  all the companies I applied to, along with some key facts (applied date, interview dates, coding challenge, etc). I saw a few people making Sankey Diagrams of their results, so I thought I would do the same. 

I downloaded the Google Sheet I was using as a .csv file and wrote a Python script to reformat my information to work with Google's Sankey Diagram visualization tools. 

## By the Numbers

I currently have an offer on the table, but I'm still actively exploring my options! As you can see, I'm still in an interview process with another company (a really cool one!!) right now, and I'm looking for an offseason/non-summer internship!

However, I'm really happy with the company that has offered me an internship, so I'm really looking forward to next summmer!
